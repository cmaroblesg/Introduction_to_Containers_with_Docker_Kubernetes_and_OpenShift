# The Kubernetes Ecosystem: OpenShift, Istio, etc.

## Introduction
In this module, you will learn about the growing Kubernetes ecosystem and be introduced to some additional tools that work well with Kubernetes to support cloud-native development. You’ll learn about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which hosts Kubernetes, and the valuable resources it provides for navigating the ecosystem. You’ll gain an understanding of both the similarities and the differences of Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, and what an OpenShift architecture looks like. You will become familiar with OpenShift builds and BuildConfigs and learn about the various build strategies and triggers offered by OpenShift. Operators use custom resources and controllers to help package software and automate tasks within a cluster. In this module, you'll learn how an operator can deploy an entire application with ease. Finally, you'll learn about Istio, a service mesh, which provides traffic management and security, and facilitates communication between services in an application. At the end of the module, you do a hands-on exercise in which you use the oc CLI to perform commands on an OpenShift cluster. You will use the OpenShift build capabilities to deploy an application from source code stored in a git repository.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain why it is necessary to have an ecosystem around Kubernetes and identify 4 tools within the Kubernetes Ecosystem
* Describe the relationship between Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, as well as their similarities and differences
* Explain the OpenShift build strategies and the three build triggers that stipulate when a build should run.
* Explain what an operator is and how operators help automate tasks within a cluster.
* Describe the capabilities Istio provides and why these capabilities are important for microservices.
* Inspect a BuildConfig and an ImageStream
* Build and deploy an application using s2i
* Use the OpenShift web console
* Use the oc CLI
