# Understanding Kubernetes Architecture
## Introduction
In this module, you will learn what container orchestration is and how it helps to create and manage the lifecycle of complex container environments. Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform. In this module, we will familiarize you with the key architectural components of Kubernetes, such as the control plane components and controllers. You will also learn about the basics of Kubernetes objects, and how specific Kubernetes objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments work. The Kubernetes CLI, or "kubectl", is used to manipulate objects and manage workloads in a Kubernetes cluster. We will introduce you to a few basic kubectl commands and explain the relative benefits and shortcomings of both imperative and declarative commands. Finally, at the end of this module, you will use the kubectl CLI commands to create resources on an actual Kubernetes cluster.
